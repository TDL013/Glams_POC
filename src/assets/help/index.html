<h1 id="australian-government-property-register">Australian Government Property Register</h1>
<p>The Australian Government Property Register (AGPR) (formerly GLAMS) incorporates two data sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leased Estate – which is the former GLAMS dataset; and  </li>
<li>Owned Estate – which is a dataset of Commonwealth owned land.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AGPR also has a Property Marketplace which advertises vacant workspace and surplus land. 
This user guide covers all three sections of the AGPR application.</p>
<h2 id="requesting-access">Requesting Access</h2>
<p>The AGPR is an Australian Government business application. All users must be authenticated prior to an account being set up.</p>
<p>To request user access, an email from an Executive Level 2 officer (at minimum) is to be sent to the <a href="mailto:propertydata@finance.gov.au">propertydata@finance.gov.au</a> group mailbox.</p>
<p>The requestor is responsible for ensuring that only those personnel that have a need to know, are given access to the AGPR application. Where there is an agency staffing change, entities are to inform Finance as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>Access to the AGPR will be granted to all users for a 12-month period (period starts from initial request) and user audits will occur every 6 months. If a user does not reply to an audit request, their account will be suspended and the user will need to request an account unlock by emailing <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#112;&#114;&#111;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#116;&#121;&#100;&#97;&#116;&#97;&#64;&#102;&#105;&#110;&#97;&#110;&#99;&#101;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#46;&#97;&#117;">&#112;&#114;&#111;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#116;&#121;&#100;&#97;&#116;&#97;&#64;&#102;&#105;&#110;&#97;&#110;&#99;&#101;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#46;&#97;&#117;</a>.</p>
<p>In accordance with the relevant Information Security Manual control, no shared use non-specific accounts will be created, e.g. user name is a group mailbox - property@entity.gov.au.
A draft request email is provided below for your use:</p>

<h2 id="divest-land-use-and-public-display-how-are-these-data-used">Divest, land use and public display - How are these data used?</h2>
<p>It is important to understand how the application uses the data provided. Your response to some data fields within a land parcel can drive additional functionality and processes within Government. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Suitable for public display – Yes/No buttons?</strong><br />
The Department of Finance maintains a publicly facing list of properties on the Australian Government Property Register. All properties that are recorded as suitable for public display will be shown on this list accessible through Finance’s website, i.e. ‘Suitable for public display’ = Yes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the land surplus to agency requirements – Yes/No buttons?</strong> 
The ‘Current land use’ section collects data to help determine if the parcel of land is surplus to agency requirements. By declaring the land as surplus, Finance will then engage with the agency to consider alternate uses for the land.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Divestment</strong><br />
Land parcels that are surplus to an agency’s requirements can be divested to either another commonwealth or state government agency; or to a private sector organisation. When you select that a land parcel has been divested, it will no longer appear in your agency’s data within the Owned Estate application. However, it will remain viewable through the agency reporting function.</p>

<p><strong>To roll a data collection:</strong> <br />
When you add a new collection cycle, you may wish to roll the data collection records over to the new collection cycle. When performing this function, it is important to note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The collection cycle must be in the current period, i.e. you cannot roll the data collection to a past or future dated collection cycle.  </li>
<li>It is best to ensure that all data collection records from the previous collection cycle have been completed before rolling into a new collection cycle. For example, if a lease hasn't been explicitly expired by following the instructions found under the 'Using the lease tab: to expire a lease' section as above, the system will not do this automatically and will roll these records forward to the new collection cycle, as is.  </li>
<li>Rolling the data collection to a new collection cycle can only be performed once. It cannot be reversed and the user will only be prompted about this once.      </li>
</ul>
<p>To perform this function:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the 'Roll data collection cycle' tab located in the top-left section of your screen.  </li>
<li>Read the important pop-up box about this action being irreversible.  </li>
